#Sim props:Height Width Speed Radius
#Robot
#see robot_image.py

#This program will eventually:
#1.Make image of robot
#2.Drive with 2 wheels
#3.Make accurate simulation of echolocation
#4.Have AI inputed into it
#5.Teach AI how to use echolocation so our
#robot can use echolocation to manouvere
#around our house.
